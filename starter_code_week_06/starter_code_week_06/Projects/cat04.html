            <div class="subtitle">Prior to the storm, Brucemore’s tree canopy, and many other elements of Simonds’s design, had been in steady decline. In 2020, only 15 percent of the original canopy was intact, after successive waves of Dutch elm disease and emerald ash borer infestations culled the trees. </div>

                <p>Brett Seelman, ASLA, a native of eastern Iowa and the founder of Seelman Landscape Architecture (SLA) in Cedar Rapids, says that by the 1980s, nothing remained of the original Simonds design beyond the formal garden. “What the derecho did was sweep out all of these evergreens. I don’t think you could ever put in a report that, ‘If you want to take this property back to [its historic era], you need to remove 400 trees.’ But this storm allowed for that opportunity in an unprecedented way.” Seelman and his firm are rehabilitating Bruce-more’s landscape and attempting to answer the hard questions raised by the derecho’s destruction.</p>

            <div class="subtitle">Tokyo has never been high on my personal list of places to see before I die. Not because it’s far away; I’m an intrepid traveler who’s flown farther many times before. But in the past, whenever anyone has mentioned the Tokyo metropolitan area, my mind conjured up images of a sprawling city populated with more than 12 million people crowding concrete streets lined with high-rise buildings, blinding neon, and packed subway stations.</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>With one final night to spend, I finally succeeded in immersing myself in the real Tokyo. I headed to Sasagin, a small sake pub across from Yoyogi-Uehara station. An eclectic crowd of young singles and urban professionals filled the tiny room with straw-colored walls. I grabbed a stool at the six-seat sushi bar next to a table of six salarymen. Still in their white shirts and ties, they had removed their suit coats, indicating that they were now in casual mode. Like their American counterparts, they were in a post-work ritualistic bonding celebration. However, unlike their American counterparts, the salarymen follow an unwritten code of conduct at these gatherings: they never roll up their shirtsleeves or take off their ties, and the most important man in the group always fills their tasting glasses. I watched as the men laughed, toasted kanpai (cheers), and ate sushi.</p>

            <div class="subtitle">"On the contrary, it is frequently objected that the decorative use of the Orders so conspicuous in Renaissance architecture did not express structure, that it was contrary to construction, and, for that reason, vicious. "</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>Considering architecture's long history of service to clients with evil as well as good intentions, it is interesting and a little amusing to find that architecture, at least in print, invariably uses polite language when discussing its clientele, reserving strong words for quiet issues like the decorative value of the orders. This practice is not new; architectural writings – particularly in the 19 th century – are full of harsh language on the styles of architecture. During that century, a dispute concerning the revival of classic and of gothic design was waged over several decades with such vigour that it was named the " Battle of the Styles. " Phrases like " foul torrent of the Renaissance " and " barbarous violence " (of Renaissance garden design) were commonly used in the battle of the styles.</p>

                <p>Memorializing horrific events with architecture is necessarily fraught. Should a building attempt to reflect the brutality and trauma experienced by the victims of unimaginable violence? Should it create a forbidding or unsettling environment? Some architects say yes—the best-known example being Daniel Libeskind and his 2001 Jewish Museum Berlin, with its zigzagging plan and slice-like, angled windows.</p>

A few offered reflections on the absence of satisfactory living spaces in subdivided apartments or the disappearance of the living room in London’s overheated housing market.

            <div class="subtitle">Why urban design is larger than architecture: the foundational qualities of urban design, examples and practitioners</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>Urban design in practice is incremental, but architects imagine it as scaled-up architecture—large, ready-to-build pop-up cities. This paradox of urban design is rarely addressed; indeed, urban design as a discipline lacks a theoretical foundation. In The Largest Art, Brent Ryan argues that urban design encompasses more than architecture, and he provides a foundational theory of urban design beyond the architectural scale. In a “declaration of independence” for urban design, Ryan describes urban design as the largest of the building arts, with qualities of its own.</p>

                An exhibition that will expand the power of imagination for the city,

            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>The mundane streetscapes of the city become a holy place for stories beloved by a certain someone. In the city, filled with people coming and going, there are as many different landscapes as there are people. Nor is it only people who live in the city. Insects, plants, AI, robots... what does the city look seen from each of their perspectives?
                    Attachments only you feel, the sense that something is there, the little events you discover. This exhibition focuses on phenomena that evoke invisible things within the city. Eight groups of artists with perceptive foresight will exhibit works that connect these “invisibles” with their abilities to imagine what future cities will be. Here, you will see landscapes as seen by AI or artificial life, and the shape of the city lived in by humans a hundred years hence.

            <div class="hover-content">
                <p> Coming from modest backgrounds, Lee Yuan’s parents worked as farmers in Luoyang, classified as an “agricultural hukou”. Witnessing her parents’ arduous labor in the fields, Lee relocated to Guangzhou after college, seeking enhanced economic opportunities. As an architect in the bustling urban center of Guangzhou, Lee enjoys elevated wages, a higher standard of living, and the potential for career advancement—opportunities unattainable in Luoyang. Despite the apparent advantages of urban life compared to her rural origins, Lee continues to face a myriad of social inequalities due to her rural hukou status, emphasizing that “I am legally obligated to return to my hometown (place of birth) for my registration and social welfare benefits. Guangzhou can never fully be my place if I am always tied to Luoyang” (2023). </p>

            <div class="subtitle">Community development planning consists of a public participatory and usually interactive form of town or neighborhood planning and design in which diverse community members (often termed “stakeholders”) contribute toward formulation of the goals, objectives, planning, fund/resource identification and direction, planned project implementations and reevaluation of documented local planning policy.</div>

                <p>It is a logical “bottom-up” evolution of (formerly “top-down”) regional, city and urban planning in an era of plateaued or diminishing public resources, increasing local burdens and responsibilities and public activism. It often promotes public/private partnership as a means to harness physical development activities in support of community-defined goals.At a minimum, it seeks community consensus for proposed allocations of scarce resources among competing demands. In more vigorous application, community members access a full gamut of planning tools, shaping and being shaped by shared understanding of a complex community information base, directly informing and guiding local plan content, influencing resulting development budgets, projects and thus future infrastructure and land uses, as well as helping coordinate the work of overlapping jurisdictions, levels of government, internal and adjacent communities and various providers, such as business associations, utilities and schools.</p>

Visitors enter through a lobby that looks down into an octagonal atrium dominated by enormous dinosaur skeletons posed as if on the brink of carnage. Beyond the atrium’s glazed rear facade is a narrow concrete terrace.</div>

                <p>This wooded ravine, which is sort of the reason the museum exists, was neglected and inaccessible until a recent intervention by Sylvatica Studio. Now, beginning right at the atrium’s back doors and set into the terrace’s pavement, the wooden planking of an elevated walkway leads into the trees. Not far along the walkway, just visible where it turns, a 26-foot-high, latticelike but curvilinear “tree pod” beckons from the midst of branches and leaves. Its shape and color mimic the blossom of the tulip tree, a common tree in these woods.  </p>
