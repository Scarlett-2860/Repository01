                <p>Memorializing horrific events with architecture is necessarily fraught. Should a building attempt to reflect the brutality and trauma experienced by the victims of unimaginable violence? Should it create a forbidding or unsettling environment? Some architects say yes—the best-known example being Daniel Libeskind and his 2001 Jewish Museum Berlin, with its zigzagging plan and slice-like, angled windows.</p>

            <div class="title">Fire Resistant Building Special/Fujinofi Yamasaki</div>
            <div class="subtitle">Firestopping is the use of fire-resistant seals at points of penetration in a fire-rated construction to prevent the spread of fire and smoke. Firestopping seals gaps created in walls, floors, or ceilings by penetrants like pipes, ductwork, and cables that can give fire and hot gasses free access to other areas of a structure.</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>This also applies to membrane penetrations, which do not pierce all the way through the construction. For example, an unsealed electrical box can lower the fire rating it provides by exposing the wall’s interior to fire。
                    In the case of things like cables, conduits, and non-metallic piping, firestop products can also protect these materials from fire damage in addition to filling gaps.
                    Common firestop materials include silicones, rubbers, mineral wool, and cementitious mortars. Each of these materials has different features and chemical qualities, so be sure to research your firestopping products carefully.</p>

            <div class="subtitle">Why urban design is larger than architecture: the foundational qualities of urban design, examples and practitioners</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>Urban design in practice is incremental, but architects imagine it as scaled-up architecture—large, ready-to-build pop-up cities. This paradox of urban design is rarely addressed; indeed, urban design as a discipline lacks a theoretical foundation. In The Largest Art, Brent Ryan argues that urban design encompasses more than architecture, and he provides a foundational theory of urban design beyond the architectural scale. In a “declaration of independence” for urban design, Ryan describes urban design as the largest of the building arts, with qualities of its own.</p>

                <p> In the residential building sector designers all over the world are developing innovative concepts that combine functionality and aesthetics. Ideally, purpose and beauty merge into a symbiosis that serves the user. A key factor is where the property is to be built: its location. What are the prevailing climate conditions, what are the cultural criteria? Whereas in southern climes windows tend to be small, for example, in order to reduce the light incidence and keep homes cool, that is not a crucial factor in the north, where large glass frontages are in demand to catch as much sunlight as possible. </p>
