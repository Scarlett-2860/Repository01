            <p style="color: #6a6ac5; font-family:Seaweed Script;font-size: 20px;">In my free time, I often choose architecture magazines to read aimlessly, without any specific plan. Over time, I realized that the process of selecting a magazine itself becomes a quick experience of appreciating and interpreting the covers. Aside from the obvious distinctions, like the differences in cover design and layout among magazines founded in different eras, the type of architecture magazine significantly influences the cover layout based on its content focus. This unique style and emphasis are often reflected in the choice of cover text, imagery, and composition.
                I think I can roughly categorize architecture magazines based on these distinct cover design influences into: architectural design and art magazines, academic and theoretical architecture magazines, professional architectural technology magazines, landscape and urban planning magazines, architecture and social culture magazines, and architecture and environmental sustainability magazines.</p>
