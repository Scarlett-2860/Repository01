            <div class="subtitle">What is a good room? For this issue, The Architectural Review asked architects, curators and writers to describe a good domestic setting – real, remembered or imagined.</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>For some, the room is one designed by Álvaro Siza or Jean-François Zevaco; for others, it is one depicted in an artwork, from a Berliner Zimmer in an 1845 painting by Adolph Menzel, to a pavilion painted in a 14th-century Chinese scroll by Ni Zan. A few offered reflections on the absence of satisfactory living spaces in subdivided apartments or the disappearance of the living room in London’s overheated housing market. Good rooms are also recognised in the AR House awards, now in their 15th year and continuing to question the possibilities of the house’s form and programme.</p>

            <div class="subtitle">In 1941, Swiss engineer George de Mestral was coming back from a hunting trip with his dog when he noticed that some seeds kept sticking to his clothes and his dog's fur. He observed that they contained several "hooks" that caught on anything with a loop, and from studying this plant, seven years later, he invented the hook and loop fastener, which he named Velcro.</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>This "biomimetic revolution" is now considered to be a major guideline towards more sustainable built environments, meaning that buildings are focused on learning from nature rather than only extracting elements from it.
                    Pawlyn also mentions a more recent example, which is the Eastgate Centre, a shopping mall and office block in Harare, Zimbabwe. Its design was inspired by termite mounds and their biological system of temperature control in extreme environments, thereby avoiding air-conditioners. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">How much do you really know about the systems that keep a city alive? "The Works: Anatomy of a City" contains everything you ever wanted to know about what makes New York City run. When you flick on your light switch the light goes on--how? When you put out your garbage, where does it go? When you flush your toilet, what happens to the waste? How does water get from a reservoir in the mountains to your city faucet? How do flowers get to your corner store from Holland, or bananas get there from Ecuador? </div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>"The Works: Anatomy of a City" offers a cross section of this hidden infrastructure, using beautiful, innovative graphic images combined with short, clear text explanations to answer all the questions about the way things work in a modern city. It describes the technologies that keep the city functioning, as well as the people who support them-the pilots that bring the ships in over the Narrows sandbar, the sandhogs who are currently digging the third water tunnel under Manhattan, the television engineer who scales the Empire State Building's antenna for routine maintenance, the electrical wizards who maintain the century-old system that delivers power to subways.
                    "The Works" is for anyone who has ever stopped midcrosswalk, looked at the rapidly moving metropolis around them, and wondered, how does this all work?

                </div>
            <div class="subtitle">In the 1930s, Mies was the last director of the Bauhaus, a ground-breaking school of modernist art, design and architecture. After Nazism's rise to power, with its strong opposition to modernism, Mies emigrated to the United States. He accepted the position to head the architecture school at what is today the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT).</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>Mies sought to establish his own particular architectural style that could represent modern times. His buildings made use of modern materials such as industrial steel and plate glass to define interior spaces. He is often associated with his fondness for the aphorisms "less is more" and "God is in the details".</p>

                </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Mies was born March 27, 1886, in Aachen, Germany. He worked in his father's stone carving shop and at several local design firms before he moved to Berlin, where he joined the office of interior designer Bruno Paul. </div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>He began his architectural career as an apprentice at the studio of Peter Behrens from 1908 to 1912, where he was exposed to the current design theories and to progressive German culture. He worked alongside Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, who was later also involved in the development of the Bauhaus. Mies served as construction manager of the Embassy of the German Empire in Saint Petersburg under Behrens.
                    Ludwig Mies renamed himself as part of his transformation from a tradesman's son to an architect working with Berlin's cultural elite, adding "van der" and his mother's maiden name "Rohe" and using the Dutch "van der", because the German form "von" was a nobiliary particle legally restricted to those of German nobility lineage. He began his independent professional career designing upper-class homes.

Gursky’s piece Media Markt heightens this anxiety by showing the shelves upon shelves of vacuum cleaners and irons and coffee machines (and the list goes on). Or his work Amazon which depicts endless rows of packages waiting to be delivered. Since Amazon is an online shopping platform, the amount of stuff it entails is actually infinite unbounded by the possibilities of the web. </p>
