            <div class="subtitle">Not because it’s far away; I’m an intrepid traveler who’s flown farther many times before. But in the past, whenever anyone has mentioned the Tokyo metropolitan area, my mind conjured up images of a sprawling city populated with more than 12 million people crowding concrete streets lined with high-rise buildings, blinding neon, and packed subway stations.</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>With one final night to spend, I finally succeeded in immersing myself in the real Tokyo. I headed to Sasagin, a small sake pub across from Yoyogi-Uehara station. An eclectic crowd of young singles and urban professionals filled the tiny room with straw-colored walls. I grabbed a stool at the six-seat sushi bar next to a table of six salarymen. Still in their white shirts and ties, they had removed their suit coats, indicating that they were now in casual mode. Like their American counterparts, they were in a post-work ritualistic bonding celebration. However, unlike their American counterparts, the salarymen follow an unwritten code of conduct at these gatherings: they never roll up their shirtsleeves or take off their ties, and the most important man in the group always fills their tasting glasses. I watched as the men laughed, toasted kanpai (cheers), and ate sushi.</p>

                <p>Cities and regions grow (or occasionally decline), and continuously transform themselves as they do so. This book describes the theory and practice of modeling the spatial dynamics of urban growth and transformation. As cities are complex, adaptive, self-organizing systems, the most appropriate modeling framework is one based on the theory of self-organizing systems—an approach already used in such fields as physics and ecology.  </p>

                <p>Memorializing horrific events with architecture is necessarily fraught. Should a building attempt to reflect the brutality and trauma experienced by the victims of unimaginable violence? Should it create a forbidding or unsettling environment? Some architects say yes—the best-known example being Daniel Libeskind and his 2001 Jewish Museum Berlin, with its zigzagging plan and slice-like, angled windows.
                    A number of the houses appeared in the magazine in iconic black-and-white photographs by architectural photographer Julius Shulman.</p>

            <div class="subtitle">Community development planning consists of a public participatory and usually interactive form of town or neighborhood planning and design in which diverse community members (often termed “stakeholders”) contribute toward formulation of the goals, objectives, planning, fund/resource identification and direction, planned project implementations and reevaluation of documented local planning policy. It is a logical “bottom-up” evolution of (formerly “top-down”) regional, city and urban planning in an era of plateaued or diminishing public resources, increasing local burdens and responsibilities and public activism. </div>

                <p>It is a logical “bottom-up” evolution of (formerly “top-down”) regional, city and urban planning in an era of plateaued or diminishing public resources, increasing local burdens and responsibilities and public activism. It often promotes public/private partnership as a means to harness physical development activities in support of community-defined goals.[1] At a minimum, it seeks community consensus for proposed allocations of scarce resources among competing demands. In more vigorous application, community members access a full gamut of planning tools, shaping and being shaped by shared understanding of a complex community information base, directly informing and guiding local plan content, influencing resulting development budgets, projects and thus future infrastructure and land uses, as well as helping coordinate the work of overlapping jurisdictions, levels of government, internal and adjacent communities and various providers, such as business associations, utilities and schools.</p>

                <p>Initially known as a theorist exploring the spatial-political implications of the May 1968 uprisings, Bernard Tschumi emerged as an architect of international repute in the 1980s with his Parc de la Villette, a 125-acre cultural park located in northeastern Paris. His buildings and design theory famously draw on an array of disciplines, such as literature, cinema and philosophy.
