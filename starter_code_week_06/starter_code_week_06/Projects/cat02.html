                </div>
            <div class="subtitle">What is a good room? For this issue, The Architectural Review asked architects, curators and writers to describe a good domestic setting – real, remembered or imagined.</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>For some, the room is one designed by Álvaro Siza or Jean-François Zevaco; for others, it is one depicted in an artwork, from a Berliner Zimmer in an 1845 painting by Adolph Menzel, to a pavilion painted in a 14th-century Chinese scroll by Ni Zan. A few offered reflections on the absence of satisfactory living spaces in subdivided apartments or the disappearance of the living room in London’s overheated housing market. Good rooms are also recognised in the AR House awards, now in their 15th year and continuing to question the possibilities of the house’s form and programme.</p>

            <div class="title">Biomimetics of Architecture</div>
            <div class="subtitle">In 1941, Swiss engineer George de Mestral was coming back from a hunting trip with his dog when he noticed that some seeds kept sticking to his clothes and his dog's fur. He observed that they contained several "hooks" that caught on anything with a loop, and from studying this plant, seven years later, he invented the hook and loop fastener, which he named Velcro.</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>This "biomimetic revolution" is now considered to be a major guideline towards more sustainable built environments, meaning that buildings are focused on learning from nature rather than only extracting elements from it.
                    Pawlyn also mentions a more recent example, which is the Eastgate Centre, a shopping mall and office block in Harare, Zimbabwe. Its design was inspired by termite mounds and their biological system of temperature control in extreme environments, thereby avoiding air-conditioners. </p>

            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>Buildings shape our identity and sense of self in profound ways that are not always evident toarchitects and town planners, or even to those who think they are intimately familiar with thebuildings they inhabit. Architecture and the Mimetic Selfprovides a useful theoretical guide toour unconscious behaviour in relation to buildings, and explains both how and why we aredrawn to specific elements and features of architectural design. lt reveals how even the mostuninspiring of buildings can be modified to meet our unconscious expectations andrequirements of them and, by the same token, it explores the repercussions for oulwellbeing when buildings fail to do so.  </p>

            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Geisel Library is the main library building of the University of California, San Diego. It is named in honor of Audrey and Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as children's author Dr. Seuss. The building's distinctive architecture, described as occupying "a fascinating nexus between brutalism and futurism", has made it an iconic and widely recognized building on campus. The library is located in the center of the UC San Diego campus.</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>The library was designed by William Pereira and opened in 1970 as the Central Library. It was renovated in 1993 and rededicated as the University Library Building, and renamed Geisel Library in 1995.
                    The library houses over seven million volumes to support the educational and research objectives of the university. It also contains the Mandeville Special Collections and Archives, which houses the Dr. Seuss Collection, which contains original drawings, sketches, proofs, notebooks, manuscript drafts, books, audio and videotapes, photographs, and memorabilia.The approximately 8,500 items in the collection document the full range of Dr. Seuss's creative achievements, beginning in 1919 with his high school activities and ending with his death in 1991.</p>

            <div class="title">Ja117-Spring117/Kunio Maekawa
            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Issue 117 of JA features Kunio Maekawa (1905-1986). Kunio Maekawa closely intertwined both modernism and Japanese-ness in his architecture, and worked to establish the identity of Japanese architecture in the context of modernism. Based on the ideas of the Belgian architect and guest editor Hera Van Sande, this issue approaches Kunio Maekawa’s work from the following four aspects.</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>First, the influence of Le Corbusier’s ideas on Maekawa in terms of modernism. Secondly, the sublimating of the spatial characteristics inherent in traditional Japanese architecture into Maekawa’s own architecture. Thirdly, Maekawa’s advocating of the transcendence of modernism and localism. Finally, the liberating design approach that Maekawa arrived at, which creates a natural and peaceful space. These are introduced through four essays by Van Sande, who has written extensively on the subject, a conversation with Hiroshi Matsukuma, and 22 of Maekawa’s architecture projects.</p>

                Architectural Detailing systematically describes the principles by which good architectural details are designed.Principles are explained in brief, and backed by extensive illustrations that show you how to design details that will not leak water or air, will control the flow of heat and water vapor, will adjust to all kinds of movement, and will be easy to construct.</div>

                <p>This new third edition has been updated to conform to International Building Code 2012, and incorporates current knowledge about new material and construction technology. Sustainable design issues are integrated where relevant, and the discussion includes reviews of recent built works that extract underlying principles that can be the basis for new patterns or the alteration and addition to existing patterns. Regulatory topics are primarily focused on the US, but touch on other jurisdictions and geographic settings to give you a well-rounded perspective of the art and science of architectural detailing.</p>

                <p>A series of iconic houses quickly established the firm’s international acclaim, but in the past decade their projects have expanded greatly in scale and diversified in building type. The intense investigative nature that characterizes every project is often veiled behind playfulness and simplicity. What began as an “Architecture of Approximation” in the first decade of their practice eventuated in a body of work consisting of “Extremes and In-betweens,” as described in 2 essays written by Sharon Johnston and Mark Lee. Twenty-six key projects, ranging from houses and exhibitions to museums and institutions, are presented here alongside 8 thematic collages to convey the full range of Johnston Marklee’s works. Interspersed is a series of 12 commentaries by collaborators and colleagues, bringing the work of Johnston Marklee “to life with their interpretations.” </p>
