            <div class="subtitle">The theory and practice of modeling cities and regions as complex, self-organizing systems, presenting widely used cellular automata-based models, theoretical discussions, and applications.</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>Cities and regions grow (or occasionally decline), and continuously transform themselves as they do so. This book describes the theory and practice of modeling the spatial dynamics of urban growth and transformation. As cities are complex, adaptive, self-organizing systems, the most appropriate modeling framework is one based on the theory of self-organizing systems—an approach already used in such fields as physics and ecology.  </p>

            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">The Case Study Houses were experiments in American residential architecture sponsored by Arts & Architecture magazine, which commissioned major architects of the day, including Richard Neutra, Raphael Soriano, Craig Ellwood, Charles and Ray Eames, Pierre Koenig, Eero Saarinen, A. Quincy Jones, Edward Killingsworth, Rodney Walker, and Ralph Rapson to design and build inexpensive and efficient model homes for the United States residential housing boom caused by the end of World War II and the return of millions of soldiers.</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>The program ran intermittently from 1945 until 1966. The first six houses were built by 1948 and attracted more than 350,000 visitors. While not all 36 designs were built, most of those that were constructed were built in Los Angeles, and one was built in San Rafael, Northern California and one in Phoenix, Arizona. Of the unbuilt houses, #19 was to have been built in Atherton, in the San Francisco Bay Area, while #27 was to have been built on the east coast, in Smoke Rise, New Jersey.
                    A number of the houses appeared in the magazine in iconic black-and-white photographs by architectural photographer Julius Shulman.</p>

            <div class="subtitle">"On the contrary, it is frequently objected that the decorative use of the Orders so conspicuous in Renaissance architecture did not express structure, that it was contrary to construction, and, for that reason, vicious. "</div>
            <div class="hover-content">
                <p>Considering architecture's long history of service to clients with evil as well as good intentions, it is interesting and a little amusing to find that architecture, at least in print, invariably uses polite language when discussing its clientele, reserving strong words for quiet issues like the decorative value of the orders. This practice is not new; architectural writings – particularly in the 19 th century – are full of harsh language on the styles of architecture. During that century, a dispute concerning the revival of classic and of gothic design was waged over several decades with such vigour that it was named the " Battle of the Styles. " Phrases like " foul torrent of the Renaissance " and " barbarous violence " (of Renaissance garden design) were commonly used in the battle of the styles.</p>

            <div class="subtitle">Community development planning consists of a public participatory and usually interactive form of town or neighborhood planning and design in which diverse community members (often termed “stakeholders”) contribute toward formulation of the goals, objectives, planning, fund/resource identification and direction, planned project implementations and reevaluation of documented local planning policy. It is a logical “bottom-up” evolution of (formerly “top-down”) regional, city and urban planning in an era of plateaued or diminishing public resources, increasing local burdens and responsibilities and public activism. </div>

                <p>It is a logical “bottom-up” evolution of (formerly “top-down”) regional, city and urban planning in an era of plateaued or diminishing public resources, increasing local burdens and responsibilities and public activism. It often promotes public/private partnership as a means to harness physical development activities in support of community-defined goals.[1] At a minimum, it seeks community consensus for proposed allocations of scarce resources among competing demands. In more vigorous application, community members access a full gamut of planning tools, shaping and being shaped by shared understanding of a complex community information base, directly informing and guiding local plan content, influencing resulting development budgets, projects and thus future infrastructure and land uses, as well as helping coordinate the work of overlapping jurisdictions, levels of government, internal and adjacent communities and various providers, such as business associations, utilities and schools.</p>
